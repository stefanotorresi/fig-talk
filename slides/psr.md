## PHP Standards Recommendations

- Specification document
- Meta document

---

Standards cannot cover 100% of use cases

---

The Specification is usually formalized in a PHP Interface and a Composer package

---

Mostly driven by the needs of the community at large

---

Reference implementations must be provided

---

Not everything deserves a standard
